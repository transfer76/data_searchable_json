## Bare minimum requirements:

    Implementation must use Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and HTML (all three)
    Search logic should be implemented in Ruby and written by YOU, don't use a gem or external code for this
    Use Ruby 2.5.х, Rails 5.х, Trailblazer 2.х
    A search for Lisp Common should match a programming language named "Common Lisp"
    Writing code with reusability in mind
    Search match precision
    Search results ordered by relevance
    Support for exact matches, eg. Interpreted "Thomas Eugene", which should match "BASIC", but not "Haskell"
    Match in different fields, eg. Scripting Microsoft should return all scripting languages designed by "Microsoft"
    Support for negative searches, eg. john -array, which should match "BASIC", "Haskell", "Lisp" and "S-Lang", but not "Chapel", "Fortran" or "S".
    Solution elegance
    Visual design
    
## Keep in mind:
    
    Frameworks are allowed (Rails, of course, is needed), but not required.
    Comments are VERY useful, they help us understand your thought process
    This exercise is not meant to take more than 6 - 8 hours
    A readme file is highly encouraged
    It's preferable if you don't use a database for this small data set, instead read the JSON file
